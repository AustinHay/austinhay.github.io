        <title>Year in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/washington_monument.jpg&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 was a ridiculous year. In my mind it represents the most wild, crazy, stressful, exciting, fun and empowering year I have ever had. When I rung in 2014 last year I was in NYC with &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/p/tbT-TdBJ4l/?modal=true&quot;&gt;my beautiful girlfriend of 5 years&lt;/a&gt;. We ended up having a quiet night -- literally, we fell asleep on a couch before it was midnight. (Spoiler Alert: 2015 also involved a couch and grandpa&#39;s bed-time) The bright side is that Virginia and DC are both ridiculously beautiful places to spend the holidays.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s funny that the way we started the year was hardly how we ended up sprinting through the days to come. Looking back on my year, the best parts of 2014 were about...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chasing opportunities abroad.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Taking big risks &amp;amp; stepping outside my comfort zone.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Practicing leadership &amp;amp; becoming a better operator.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Taking my education into my own hands, especially after graduating.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trying to have more fun &amp;amp; love more.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Learning. Learning. Learning. About everything, everyone, and myself.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

But it wasn&#39;t all rosy. I also had some difficult times. In particular, the hardships taught me...
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reflect more, listen more, and be more self-aware.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stop being so damn tightly-wound.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Good, clear, obvious, and authentic communication is really at the heart of navigating life.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chill out &amp;amp; focus on bringing the best out of others.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Execute as best you possibly can on the promises you make others.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leave your ego at the door, and in this case, in 2014.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What colored these lessons from 2014 were the actual experiences I created over the year. This list isn&#39;t to &quot;humble-brag&quot;, but to give context to the lessons I learned. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;imageleft&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/friends_stanford.jpg&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;2014 Highlights:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Graduated from Stanford with dual MS degrees in Engineering.
 		&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Sidenote: This was probably the most stressful and deeply emotional process I have ever been through. I was juggling 22 units at one point and wasn&#39;t fully accepted to the MS&amp;amp;E department until late in May due to some complications with my application. I ended up writing a long letter to the Department Chair stating my case. I couldn&#39;t have made any of this happen without the love of my friends and family.&lt;/i&gt;
 		&lt;/p&gt;
 	&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://extreme.stanford.edu/what-extreme&quot;&gt;Design for Extreme Affordability&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; met some of the best people ever&lt;/a&gt;.
 	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/austin_cambodia.jpg&quot;&gt;Travelled to Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; to conduct user insights for Extreme.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Developed research on the quantitative fitness industry with one of my favorite professors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.stanford.edu/kathleen-eisenhardt&quot;&gt;Dr. Kahtleen Eisenhardt&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;After interviewing with dozens of firms, I accepted a job with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accenture.com/us-en/contact/Pages/northern-california.aspx&quot;&gt;Accenture&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Graduated and flew to NYC to participate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://devbootcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;, a 9 week intensive programming academy to learn dynamic web programming. The best part was creating awesome friendships with super-talented coders.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;After finishing my last course and wrapping up a summer in the city, I came back to CA and &lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/apartment.jpg&quot;&gt;created a new home&lt;/a&gt; with Leila in Mountain View.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Travelled to India with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.stanford.edu/portals/student/jobs-and-internships/global-engineering-programs/study-tour/india-trip-teis&quot;&gt;TEIS Stanford program&lt;/a&gt; to study business &amp;amp; entrepreneurship... and really &lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/friends_india.jpg&quot;&gt;just had a blast&lt;/a&gt; for 2 weeks.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Took off to &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/p/tOfWfAhJ6Y/?modal=true&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; with a friend from Stanford and my best friend in life.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;While travelling in Japan I accepted a great opportunity to be a Course Assistant at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scpd.stanford.edu/home&quot;&gt;Stanford SCPD&lt;/a&gt;.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Came home and used October to continue refining my skills as a web-programmer. I built a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.github.com/austinhay&quot;&gt;few cool apps&lt;/a&gt;, one of which I use everyday in my job as a course assistant at Stanford.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;In November, I enjoyed a short trip for training in &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/p/u3UdrPBJ3v/?modal=true&quot;&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me launch my professional career at Accenture.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	
	&lt;li&gt;Continued &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strava.com/athletes/3615909&quot;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, exercising and enjoying the outdoors ... although at this point I have determined I&#39;m much more of a social runner and avid gym-goer than anything else.
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, when I sat down to reflect on 2014, I had trouble processing everything because the year was jam-packed with all of these amazing opportunities, lessons, friendships, and memories.
&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;div style=&quot;width: 100%, margin: auto&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;year-in-review-photos&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/friends_apartment.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;year-in-review-photos&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/friends_extreme.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;img class=&quot;year-in-review-photos&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/jordan+austin.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;img class=&quot;year-in-review-photos&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/friends_wedding.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;img class=&quot;year-in-review-photos&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/friends_dland.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;img class=&quot;year-in-review-photos&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/friends_india_2.jpg&quot;&gt;
	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But...if I had to distill one of the most important take-aways from the year it would be that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; really are what make life so great. I think back to my year and its been the people that have made me most happy -- my wonderful family (Mom, Dad &amp;amp; Alexis), my incredible friends (there are literally too many to name). The best memories from the year have been sharing love and laughter with the people I care about. Reflecting has reminded me of this true-ism more than anything else.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what does 2015 have in store? I&#39;m not totally sure yet. Up until a few days ago I was feeling a bit overwhelmed by 2014. But no start to the year would be complete without an actionable list of goals. I like to keep things simple and sweet.
&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2015 Goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Take the time to unwind &lt;i&gt;everyday&lt;/i&gt;.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Listen, reflect, write, and improve myself.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Kill it everyday in my professional role (whether it be at Accenture or elsewhere).
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Focus more of my attention on my friends and on having fun.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How might I accomplish these goals?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Every list of goals deserves and requires a roadmap to success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Live &amp;amp; breath the attitudes I hope to convey: optimism, happiness, love, openness, determination, drive, &amp;amp; adaptive capacity.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Journal every week &amp;amp; write letters to those I love.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yoga &amp;amp; mediation every week.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Running every week (not just the gym!)
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eating clean, eating happy -- and no more sugar, because I&#39;m actually on my way to being diabetic.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Plan awesome adventures with the people that matter most to me.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get back in touch with the ocean (SCUBA time...)
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/2014-year-in-review/austin_diving.jpg&quot;&gt;In closing, this year has been pretty epic, but it just scratches the surface of the type of years I hope to be leading in the future. I started to find myself this year by taking risks, exploring new opportunities, failing early and often, but ultimately, bringing it all together to reflect on my journey and grow. That&#39;s what a year is supposed to be all-about, right? So, what are you waiting for. Take the dive. Jump into something new this year. Plan an epic adventure for 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Web Development Matters</title>
        <description>&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/nyc_2014.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last March I signed up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devbootcamp.com&quot;&gt;Dev Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, hoping to round off my education with a deep dive into front end web-programming. My lack of hard-core programming expertise non-withstanding, from my experiences it has always seemed like web programming has had a chip on its shoulder compared to more fundamental CS topics. My CS friends in grad school often compared web-programming and its frameworks to the &quot;fun&quot; part of programming that only came after more rigorous and intellectually challenging back-end work. I might never know the truth in this matter, but I have come to appreciate and highly respect web-programming for its ubiquity and its increasing importance in both technology and business.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blazing fast internet connection and a multitude of connecitivity devices has driven a real need for applications to be light, flexible, and &lt;u&gt;powered by the web&lt;/u&gt;. This shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise either. Desktop software has seen competition for a while -- see &lt;a href=&quot;http://successfulsoftware.net/2013/10/28/is-desktop-software-dead/&quot;&gt;a full breakdown&lt;a/&gt;. Even those that &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/04/the-rise-of-big-data-apps-and-the-fall-of-saas/&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; the strength of SAAS compared to upcoming Big Data Applications underscore the &quot;web&quot; characteristics of most businesses moving forward. Microsoft&#39;s move of its legacy desktop product (Office) to the cloud is a recent example highlighting that web-applications are the future of how businesses will compete and operate over the web.

        <title>Catching up to Speed</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a long time since I wrote on my blog. At the time of my last update, I was in India, half-heartedly documenting my experiences, and desperately trying to relax and cool the jet engines after a grueling start to 2014.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;imageleft&quot; src=&quot;/images/blogs/code_ex_1.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that time, things have changed in my own life. For one, I enjoyed another extended vacation in Japan and returned home feeling rejuvinated and ready to take on the world. But as the weeks transpired I became a bit exaspirated with my slated employment. Instead of letting my mind wander and prepare, I delved back into computer programming and taught myself some cool tricks. October was very much a month of self-exploration, navigating life after grad school &amp;amp; all its nuances, and reminding myself how to learn efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As November rolled about, I kept learning and building in Ruby, Rails, JS, and a few other languages. Eventually I got the idea to build a small &lt;a href=&quot;http://austinhay.com/projects&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; to help me be more efficient in my role as a CA at Stanford. Then I got some inspiration from finance and google-search analytics. Now, I&#39;m trying to stay busy with code and dive deeper into advanced topics in programming. I&#39;m not sure how this plays in the long-term, but these projects have been incredibly exciting and have pushed my intellectual curiosity further than anything else before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, I&#39;ve spent a good deal of time revamping my website and digging into the meat of how &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; static website templating works. In the next year I plan to really build out the content for the things I&#39;m passionate about. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First look at Research and Innovation in India</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Labor Day to all my loved ones at home in the US. Here in India, there was no such rest for the weary.  The stream of incessant honking and motion begins at 4 in the morning and hardly settles until midnight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday we got to take our first plunge into business in India with a visit to the General Electric John F. Welch Technology Center, a $175 million complex dedicated to GE&#39;s global research projects across its eight primary business units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complex itself was impressive, and the people it housed, even more so: here there are 2000 research engineers and scientists, two-thirds of which have PhDs. Together they have produced over 3600 US patents and leveraged research technology to drive billions of dollars of revenue across GE&#39;s business units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group was privileged to see GE&#39;s materials research and materials characterization lab along with their laser technology unit. Here, scientists study, model, and synthesize the composite metals that go into the world&#39;s most impressive turbine engines. The name of this game is all about developing novel materials that operate at high stress and heat, the main environment for airplane engines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/india-photo-2.jpg&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laser unit worked on technologies that will characterize emissions from power plants all over the world. Pardon my butchering, but in its simplest form, a laser is passed through the gas coming off an emissions tower. The light from the laser is captured after its passed through the gas and the emissions concentrations of the gases can be discovered at a very precise level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE&#39;s team is working on increasing the resolution of these measurements. From a business perspective, this makes for an interesting case as GE also is one of the world&#39;s biggest power plant manufacturers. They make the plants... and they also make the technologies that help improve emissions and meet US regulations set by the EPA. The laser system being built is synced with an ammonia injection technology that helps maintain the emissions levels of harmful greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide, at the precise level set by the EPA. So instead of building more efficient power plants, GE has an invested interest in building profitable technologies that will keep emissions at the exact level set by the EPA -- technologies that must be bought by utility companies all over the US and the world. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see GE lobbying for stricter environmental standards under the EPA... its good business sense from the perspective of the technologies they offer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we head to InfoSys and Embrace, the latter of which is a Stanford Design for Extreme Affordability founded venture. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bangaluru: Progress and Progress Needed</title>
        <description>&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/india-photo-1.jpg&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have been so surprised when I got to India. There is a noticeable technology presence in this city, known for its gathering of the world&#39;s biggest players in IT services, but poverty is still woven into the fabric of Bangalore &lt;!--more--&gt; -- as is the case with so many places in India. It was eye-opening to contrast the stories I have heard of India&#39;s rapid rise with the reality of its struggle. Trash lines the streets, cars overwhelm the city&#39;s transportation system, and people are in constant motion. The massive exodus of Indian peoples from rural to urban centers, like Bangalore, has stressed the infrastructure. I have never seen so clearly the need for improved sanitation and human health. Some of the water and WASH problems noticeable here were prevalent in Cambodia when I visited last spring as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangalore is very much a city of progress and of progress needed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accenture!</title>
        <description>&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/india-photo-4.jpg&quot;&gt;

On our first glance into Bangalore &lt;!--more--&gt;we came across one of Accenture&#39;s many offices located in the city. This wasn&#39;t the main headquarters, but it was still cool to see their presence is so dominantly displayed in India.

        <title>TECS 2013: Takeaways</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a little bit scary to look back and see how fast two weeks went by. In such a short amount of time I was exposed to an unimaginable amount of information. Everyday was filled with observation and understanding. The coolest part of going to China is that I felt like I had travelled in time to my youth where the world still felt very mysterious. &amp;nbsp;Like the world of my childhood China was so different, so big, and so deeply complex. It was incredible to get to experience this heighted type of curiosity, wonder again, and explore the nuances of life around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve set up is my best attempt at reflecting on my experiences, and I think it does a good job of capturing both the arc and main inflection points of the trip. Like all things, I think its good practice to debrief and synthesize what I learned. Here&amp;rsquo;s my list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Scale: Every time I think of this word I remember my first moments in China when I looked out over a sea of skyscrapers and condominiums. There is just nothing to describe the sight. You really cannot understand issues of population or China&amp;rsquo;s increasing metropolitan growth until you see cities like Beijing or Shanghai for yourself or travel in its labyrinth of public transportation. Size and scale is not just limited to these sectors either. China has had to plan its infrastructure and development to accommodate this immense volume of people. The Three Gorges Dam put this particular aspect into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Business in China will not be &amp;ldquo;Business as Usual&amp;rdquo;: The exploration of so many different companies in a wide variety of industries demonstrated the truly dynamic nature of business in China.&amp;nbsp; The status quo is change. Everything in China is under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerpoint presentations from various executives and their numerical keypoints may fade from my memory, but the upward trends won&amp;rsquo;t. Most of these signify that China is growing in more ways that people can believe or are willing to imagine. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe everything the media claims, or what your friends tell you. Fly here and see the country for yourself. Business in China will never be the same as it is in the US or any country for that matter. It requires a willingness to understand and adapt to the changing needs of the Chinese consumer. Approach with an open mind and be sure to leave your ego at the door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. People are still people: Fundamentally Chinese are not much different than Americans or any other person for that matter.&amp;nbsp; There are clear and undeniable differences in government, language, culture, and identity, but at base level Chinese all have basic needs and human desires. They need energy, food, water, and safety. They want good jobs, a home, a family, an education and a purpose. They seek happiness. Aren&amp;rsquo;t these the things that we all cherish so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m oversimplifying things too much, but at least for me, memories are fleeting. The best lessons are those that are simple &amp;ndash; ones that don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily tell us what to do or how to act, but change the way we think about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this respect, I&amp;rsquo;ve left one out one major aspect of my adventure to China. My peers. Throughout my trip I have blogged about my thoughts, but I have to attribute most of my realizations to the brilliant students who accompanied me on TECS 2013 and created an environment for these conversations to occur. The 16 or so students that came on the trip are the most intelligent, thoughtful, and articulate people I have ever met. Each and every one of them has a deeply rooted eagerness to listen, learn, reflect and share. They have taught me how to approach issues with an open but critical mind, and the importance of listening. They have showed me how to be humble, respectful, and attentive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More importantly, everyone on the trip has maintained a unique willingness to share about their lives, to be vulnerable, to express their true thoughts and feelings and to connect.&amp;nbsp; It was easy to create heartfelt bonds with these individuals because their core values were so well aligned with those that I cherish most in others.&amp;nbsp; Through our two weeks together I have learned that they all prioritize the things that matter most in life, like self-development, and learning. They are all truly wonderful people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes in life is, &amp;ldquo;People are at the heart of everything great.&amp;rdquo; This trip once again reminds me of this truth. Cheers to TECS 2013 and to the growth we will all gain from from this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*TECS 2013 is short for my adventures with Stanford University&#39;s TECS two week immersive business and technology program in China. Over the next two weeks I am travelling from Beijing to Shanghai and meeting with incredible businesses along the way. All posts from the program will be tagged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>TECS 2013: A Whole New Perspective from Foxconn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we first walked in to the Foxconn building I thought we must have been at the wrong place. The entrance was dark and dusty and the lights were off. Overall the place looked run-down and pretty sketchy &amp;ndash; I think this is honestly the best word to describe it! Quickly we followed an HR representative up to a small theater on the second floor where we sat through a ridiculous company introduction video. Not only was it all in Chinese, but it was so loud and the Chinese was so fast that not even our native speakers in the group could understand or translate properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/img-4595.jpg&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short and barely discernible speech from an unnamed executive we made our way to another part of the building where we got to see the facility&amp;rsquo;s R&amp;amp;D lab. The place looked like something out of Orwell&amp;rsquo;s 1984. The square complex had white washed walls with large labeled signs. Identically dressed employees in lab coats sat at stations testing technical components while we looked on through a glass partition. It felt like we were watching lab mice &amp;ndash; but these were real people! At one point we came across a series of walls that were glazed over with a white frost. The HR representative informed us that these were Apple&amp;rsquo;s secret labs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, we took a short bus ride to the factory we were going to tour. I am so incredibly grateful for this experience. I wish my deepest gratitude to Stanford and Foxconn for this experience because it truly changed me. As a note, it was made very clear that no photographs were allowed. In reality, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have mattered much: The only way to understand manufacturing at a place like Foxconn is to see if for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factory manager met us at the entrance of his plant with a welcoming smile and an informative debrief on his operation. At this particular location Foxconn manufactured a particular Apple product, which consisted of a PCB and metal casing; not the cord or anything else. I am not sure of Apple&amp;rsquo;s policy, but the last thing I want to do is get sued by my former employer or Foxconn over my writing, so I will leave this factory product unspecified.&amp;nbsp; I will say, however, that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the iPhone (wah wah) &amp;ndash; it was just an Apple accessory item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional parts of this product, like the plastic casing and the cord, were outsourced to other Foxconn facilities. Almost all of Foxconn&amp;rsquo;s products adhere to a similar type of vertical integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside we moved through a winding maze of industrial hallways. As we passed by one I looked up and noticed nets covering us overhead about 20 feet off the ground. Shivers ran down my spine when I inquired about their purpose: they were to prevent employees from committing suicide by jumping from the higher ramparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group then put on yellow visitor gowns and blue footies and walked through to the main factory floor. After exiting the blast air chamber my ears were instantly ringing with the sound of automation. Before me lay hundreds of machines clicking, whirling, buzzing and beeping as they busily fulfilled unique tasks. It was a symphony of robotic melodies all chiming in harmony as raw components were transformed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manager took us down one of the countless rows of customized machinery. He explained that each lane cost over $600,000 to create. He had a team of 500 engineers, 300 of which were automation engineers, all who had contributed to hand-building these long and dedicated production lanes. The whole thing was virtually automatic. Here and there a worker in all brown garb monitored, but the process seemed highly independent of human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the rows we finally came across what I had initially expected &amp;ndash; a factory floor of workers hunched over small workstations manipulating small electronic pieces. The manager explained that the demand for Apple products waxed and waned with different launches. Normally, his automatic machines could churn out enough of this particular Apple product to meet demand. But sometimes he had to bring in a workforce of 2,000 employees to create the component by hand. The extra workforce helped his factory meet the world&amp;rsquo;s demand during peak season. I was rather impressed to hear that since the factory&amp;rsquo;s launch it has made major production improvements. The 2,000 employees that were brought in used to number 8,000 before the automatic lines were perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued along with our tour and eventually came to a mind-blowing part of the factory where large yellow robotic arms moved with blazing speed and razor-sharp accuracy, picking up and manipulating small electrical components. At each station an employee worked &amp;ldquo;in unison&amp;rdquo; with the machine, moving plates and loading new cartridges of material after the robot had rapidly completed its task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next area in the facility was a deformation and QA/QC machine that analyzed and sorted each product in a matter of miliseconds. As we walked along I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but stop and be amazed once again: a 5 foot tall, unmanned robotic cart with supplies and other factory items moved through the factory isle blasting pop music for the employees!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our final destination in the factory was a dark room where once again the beeping sound of robots surrounded us. This time all the lights were off. The manager was nice enough to turn them on for us so we could see the production lines, but he explained that normally the lights were kept off to conserve energy. No lights or employees were needed either since this part of production was 100% automated and perfected. They could run it day and night without any kind of supervision. I was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we wrapped up our tour of Foxconn by seeing where some of the employees lived. The tall buildings oddly resembled the college dorms I lived in as an undergrad, hah. Then, I noticed again that nets surrounded all the exteriors. The manager shared that most employees at this plant were single and there was no family housing available. In their free time employees had fun events and access to on site movie theaters and computer stations with hundreds of PCs and free internet/TV. It was hard to believe that an employee could find the time or energy for much fun with such a rigorous job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;imageleft&quot; src=&quot;/images/img-4598.jpg&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I might be missing some of the details related to end of our journey because this point I was exhausted from our day and conflicted by so many different emotions. It didn&amp;rsquo;t help that the sky had become overcast and a hot rain began to fall alongside the crash of thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I rode back in the bus and watched the lightning I reflected. I was in shock at the ubiquitous nature of machines in the factory, but I was amazed again by the complex production machines and how they had been created to carry out the task of humans, albeit with tenfold efficiency and speed. At the same time, I felt strangely scared, confused, and melancholy by these machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employees in these factories work 5 to 6 days a week for over 10 hours a day. While we weren&amp;rsquo;t given any indication of their salaries some data from around the web suggests that Foxconn workers make around $400 a month, so, $20 a day or $2 an hour. Most of them are just kids with an average age of 20. All of this felt so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always imagined that our world was moving towards this Sci-Fi like state, but then to actually see it with my eyes was almost too much to handle. My heart felt for many of the factory workers after experiencing the conditions they worked in and the dull and confined lifestyle they faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this note I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to clarify my position. The conditions I saw in the factory almost brought me to tears. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to react to seeing nets that prevented employees from jumping to their deaths or how to digest the fact that the humans that work in these factories are just as much slaves to supply and demand as machines are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After careful reflection I somewhat understand now that these emotions and feelings are a function of my world-view and my privileged upbringing. My heart felt for the employees because I wish I could have done something to give them all a better life. Selfishly, I wanted the production to be completely automated so that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to endure such difficult lives. But I know this thinking is very flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend, who is a native of China, explained that in reality if some Chinese workers didn&amp;rsquo;t have these types of jobs then they might be somewhere much worse. While the factory lifestyle seemed horrible from my perspective, for many it is quite good and actually an improvement in comparison to where they came from. As I was told, working in a factory like Foxconn can provide a real means of moving out of poor and rural living and in to bigger tiered cities. It&amp;rsquo;s a socioeconomic stepping stool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions that Chinese workers face is highly controversial, but I think Foxconn gets a bad rap because of its close attachment to Apple. I think this experience really showed me that China is very different from the US and the standards of what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; differ greatly between the nations. I am still trying to come to terms with this fact. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to think and I haven&amp;rsquo;t made up my mind yet, but I know that I will probably never fully understand until I explore China more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I tried to be descriptive and give an account of my tour of Foxconn from my own eyes. Beyond my feelings, one thing that really stuck with me was the manager of the factory. He seemed like such a kind and driven leader. Not only had he started on the floor like so many of his colleagues, but he also had stayed for over a decade to work up to his role. He seemed like a compassionate man and I felt that he truly cared for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is just another instance in life where you can never evaluate things at face value. I wonder how the employees at Foxconn felt. I wonder how their backgrounds shaped their understanding of their position. I wonder what their hopes and dreams were. Even if the conditions at Foxconn are the norm, and even if the company is doing its best to take care of the employees while remaining profitable &amp;ndash; which is fundamentally sound business practice &amp;ndash; I still can&amp;rsquo;t shake my sadness. Are they really happy, and if not, will they ever be? These are all questions and thoughts that will take time to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the next two weeks I am travelling from Beijing to Shanghai and meeting with incredible businesses along the way.

        <title>TECS 2013: Touring Bao Steel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The glow of molten steel was fixating even from my vantage point 50 feet away from the mill. I could feel the heat of the bar on my face and neck.&amp;nbsp; Hissing steam burst upward as the metal slab raced through the press, compressing, stretching and cooling under surges of water and the chatter of hundreds of wheels and cranks. When the steel rolled out the other side it had transformed; it was longer and thinner, but still as bright and red as lava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;imageleft&quot; src=&quot;/images/img-4586.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Molten steel!&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;900&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have called myself an engineer since the day I entered college, but in all my years I have never seen real manufacturing. On this trip to Bao Steel, I was galvanized by how iron ore was melted down, compressed and shaped from human machinery into a steel roll weighing over 30 tons. My education has taught me to think about things theoretically and I have only known numbers and quantity from the scope of my pencil and paper.&amp;nbsp; In this instance, however, I think I finally realized the difference between &amp;ldquo;knowing&amp;rdquo; how something is manufactured and understanding it through sight. Bao&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing just scratched the surface of this realization in comparison to Foxconn and its high tech devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unforgettable Wednesday, started out like most of my other days in China &amp;ndash; bright and early with hot, smoggy skies. Before going to Bao Steel&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing plant we got to meet with one of the company&amp;rsquo;s Vice Presidents. This meeting opened with a super cheesey informational movie; after a few minutes I lost count of the number of times the voiceover said &amp;ldquo;synergy.&amp;rdquo; The VP, however, was a very sweet woman and gave us a lot of incredible insight into the company, which I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to summarize here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Bao Steel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 years on Fortune 500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; biggest crude steel producer in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; highest overall profits of steel producers in the world, but incredibly close behind competitor Pesco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;130,401 employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 overseas sales subsidiaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;39 marketing branches worldwide as well as 11 trading companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$45.7 billion in revenues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45 million tons of steel produced per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;85% of steel produced is sold in domestic market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 single roll of steel can weigh between 26 &amp;ndash; 40 tons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should become quite obvious right away that Bao is a massive company. Its history has been filled with mergers and acquisitions, both of which have contributed to higher consolidation at the cost of weakened efficiency. While it&amp;rsquo;s core industry is carbon steel, it also sells stainless steel and a cheaper &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; steel brand. Most of the steel it produces is segmented for use in the automotive, home appliance, engineering/machinery, and construction industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me most from our conversation with the VP was the fact that despite its high profits, Bao and other steel manufacturers faced extremely low margins. This seemed counterintuitive considering steel is in just about everything humans produce these days &amp;ndash; how could it possibly post low margins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the VP explained, the ore mining industry is consolidated with a few major players controlling most the market. Because of this and the fact that mining is deeply technical and requires high capital, mining companies can set steep ore prices. Meanwhile, steel manufacturing companies are widespread in China and the world. The only way to survive is often to develop better technology and undercut competitors by reducing the sales price of steel. The combination of these two phenomena has resulted in very high ore costs and very low steel prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her closing, the VP discussed the future of Bao and how it is linked to diversifying the company&amp;rsquo;s holdings. While the list included resources development and logistics, steel processing, engineering and technology, coal chemicals, financial investment, and production services, the one item that wasn&amp;rsquo;t listed on her presentation, but was absolutely implied, was real estate. This seems to be a common theme among big companies in China with lots of capital and I just wonder what the future will hold &amp;ndash; the memory of GE Capital is still fresh for most Americans&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that our small Stanford group got a special tour of one of Bao&amp;rsquo;s hot rolling mills. I did my best to describe the experience above, but words and even pictures don&amp;rsquo;t do justice. The experience was simply incredible. Despite the grime, heat, and toxic smells, it was so magnificent to see once again how human intelligence could produce machines that literally transformed earth and metal. Seeing the steel manufacturing process was a great reminder of the power of human innovation over the last century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour of the plant ended in about twenty minutes and soon enough we were on our way to a company that has gained a lot of media attention in the US for their manufacturing practices &amp;ndash; Foxconn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*TECS 2013 is short for my adventures with Stanford University&#39;s TECS two week immersive business and technology program in China. Over the next two weeks I am travelling from Beijing to Shanghai and meeting with incredible businesses along the way.

        <title>TECS 2013: Shanghai and a Trip to Hangzhou for Alibaba and Chint Solar</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first day in Shanghai actually took us outside of the city to visit well-known internet titan Alibaba as well as PV maker Chint Solar.&amp;nbsp; Our mode of transport, you ask? High speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imageright&quot; src=&quot;/images/img-4518.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Our train to Hanzhou.&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;700&quot;/&gt;I had never actually travelled on a rail like this in my life, so the experience was pretty incredible. &amp;nbsp;Beyond the sci-fi look and feel of the train&amp;rsquo;s exterior, the cabin was remarkably clean and the ride was smooth. Did I mention also that it travelled at 300 kilometers per hour? I wish there was a way I could send the memo to Cal Train back home in the Bay. More important, I think I have a newfound respect for California&amp;rsquo;s ambitions to construct a similar rail, despite its high cost. Vacuum transport is all the hype after Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s alpha design, but after experiencing high speed rail for myself, I believe that it is an amazing technology that not only is clearly working well in China, but that could have practical applications in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at Hangzhou city, our whole day consisted of visiting Alibaba and Chint Solar. At Chint we gained special access to the actual manufacturing facility and got to see PV fabrication from washing and grating the initial silicon slab to doping, cleaning, and inspecting the final cell. Much of our time at Chint consisted of understanding the solar cell manufacturing process and so there were few opportunities to jot business notes or snap photos. In reality my focus for the day lay on Alibaba, which we had visited in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, at the Stanford Center in Peking University we watched a short video on Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, so I think I had lofty expectations for the company. The Alibaba headquarters met these initial feelings just based on the beautiful complex that served many of its 25,000 employees. The HQ was a sprawling modern complex with green trees, sunny plazas and winding paths. It was enormous and reminded me of other HQs out of Silicon Valley&amp;hellip;but bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through my attention to the company&amp;rsquo;s hype and personal interest in Yahoo! I had come to understand Alibaba as something completely different than what I have discovered through the documentary at Peking and through our visit. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to break this down with greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, when we arrived at the HQ we were taken to a large conference room where we got the general company low-down from an HR representative. On the way up to the room I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice a well-used white board, a foosball table and a spread of delicious treats. Yep, this place would fit in around Mountain View.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imageleft&quot; src=&quot;/images/img-4535.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;It was hard to bridge the language barrier with the HR representative, but I think I got all the essentials. Not surprisingly, at Alibaba, culture is king. It seems the company, like its founder, Jack, focuses on creating a fun environment and holds tightly to core values in the same way any small startup might. Most of the first hour was spent detailing how Alibaba keeps their employees happy through special awards, fun days, ceremonies and daily activities. Despite these reinforcing details, I wondered how authentic the culture actually was. It was clear that Jack Ma was a legend in the company&amp;rsquo;s founding, but had expansion and growth changed this portion of the company&amp;rsquo;s identity? It was hard to tell. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we got a much more informative session with an Alibaba engineer from the cloud computing space. He spent most of the time explaining the technical side of Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s entrance into this the cloud and it was useful to see how these new services compared with those of other giants like Amazon and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, he also explained that Alibaba was not really an e-commerce company at all, but mostly an internet one. Roughly 70% of Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s revenues come from its person-to-person website Tao Bao, of which 100% of revenues are from advertisements alone. The rest of Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s overall profits are segmented among its variety of projects, including Alibaba.com, which provides a platform for business-to-business transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Tao Bao is essentially like eBay in the United States (&amp;hellip;actually they pushed eBay out of the China market in their rise to fame), but Tao Bao doesn&amp;rsquo;t charge transaction fees, and unlike Amazon, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold inventory or have any delivery infrastructure. Instead it cultivates a space where Chinese individuals can transact in a way that is more sensitive to their cultural needs than a platform like eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one example of this, Tao Bao has a chat box function on their site where individuals can communicate, bargain on price and other order details, get to know each other better, and build trust before transacting. These are all fundamental aspects of Chinese culture and so the move seems natural. In the US, however, this feature on a website like eBay would drive away all its American users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, Alibaba really gained control of the Chinese market by tailoring its service to its people. While it seems almost obvious, this is a point that has come up across almost all the companies we have visited. It has been shocking to hear how many international companies take models that work in the US and Europe and try to simple apply them to the Chinese market, expecting it to work perfectly and to gain control of much larger volumes of customers. This simply isn&amp;rsquo;t true. If I take away anything from this trip it&amp;rsquo;s that you can never underestimate the power and magnitude of culture in business within China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future Alibaba appears poised to dominate the micro-lending and cloud-computing markets in the country. In China, the credit system appears broken and big central banks hardly lend to the country&amp;rsquo;s 1.2 billion population. This has created major opportunities for small lending and Alibaba hopes to leverage the customer data from its many platforms in order to better assess the risk of default among its borrowers and to offer the best rates possible based on this information.

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, the cloud-computing sector posts very low profit margins and comes with extremely high upfront capital costs, but China is in need of this database infrastructure. In light of the US NSA&amp;rsquo;s requests to domestic companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft among others, it will be especially interesting to see how the Chinese government approaches Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s new data resources in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for global outlook, right now Alibaba has no incentive to enter the US market because of competition and because its core competencies are linked to the market it serves: China. In my mind Alibaba is approaching its growth carefully and with an odd sense of humility. Perhaps this is something more US companies could learn from&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s look at tech and solar further sharpened my insight into these industries and gave the whole group useful perspective on where these companies and their products are headed within the China market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we head to Bao Steel &amp;amp; Foxconn to take a deeper look at manufacturing and to see both how steel is made and how Apple lightning connectors are assembled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*TECS 2013 is short for my adventures with Stanford University&#39;s TECS two week immersive business and technology program in China. Over the next two weeks I am travelling from Beijing to Shanghai and meeting with incredible businesses along the way. All posts from the program will be tagged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
